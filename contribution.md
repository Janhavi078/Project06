Contributing to Our Project
First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project! We're excited to have you here. Every contribution, no matter how small, is valuable to us.

This document is a guide to help you through the process of contributing. We want to make it as easy and transparent as possible.

Code of Conduct
We have a Code of Conduct that we expect all contributors to adhere to. Please take a moment to read it to understand our community standards and ensure a positive and welcoming environment for everyone.

How Can I Contribute?
There are many ways to contribute, from writing code and documentation to reporting bugs and suggesting new features.

Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please create an issue in our repository. Before you do, please check existing issues to see if someone has already reported it.

When creating a bug report, please include:

A clear and descriptive title.

A detailed description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it.

Information about your environment (e.g., operating system, browser version).

Any relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages.

Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please create an issue. This allows us to discuss your idea and see how it fits into our project's roadmap.

Please provide as much detail as possible, including why you think the enhancement is needed and how you envision it working.

Your First Code Contribution
Ready to write some code? Hereâ€™s how to get started:

Find an issue to work on.
We label issues that are good for new contributors with good first issue. These are a great place to start! You can also look for issues labeled help wanted. If you want to work on an issue, please leave a comment so we know you're on it.

Fork the repository.
Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This will create a copy of our project in your own GitHub account.

Clone your fork.
Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME.git)

Create a new branch.
It's important to create a new branch for your changes. Give it a descriptive name related to the issue you're working on.

git checkout -b your-descriptive-branch-name

Set up your development environment.
Follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up the project locally and install any dependencies.

Make your changes.
Now you can start making your code changes! Make sure to follow our coding style guides.

Commit your changes.
Write a clear and concise commit message.

git commit -m "feat: Describe your feature or fix"

Push your changes to your fork.

git push origin your-descriptive-branch-name

Create a Pull Request (PR).
Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button. Make sure the base branch is our main or develop branch and the compare branch is your feature branch.

In your PR description, please:

Link to the issue you are resolving (e.g., Closes #123).

Provide a clear summary of the changes you made.

Include any relevant screenshots or GIFs if you made UI changes.

Wait for a review.
A maintainer will review your pull request. We may ask for changes. Once your PR is approved, we will merge it. Congratulations!

Style Guides
Git Commit Messages
Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.

Reference issues and pull requests liberally in the body of the commit message.

Please follow the coding style of the existing codebase.

If we have a linter configured, please make sure your code passes all the checks.
